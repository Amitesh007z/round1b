# Git Push Guide - Round 1B

## 🚀 Quick Git Push (Recommended - Without Models)

This is the **recommended approach** for your submission:

```bash
# 1. Initialize Git repository (if not already done)
git init

# 2. Add all files (excluding models)
git add .

# 3. Commit your changes
git commit -m "Round 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence System"

# 4. Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 📦 Git Push with Models (Optional)

If you want to include offline models in your repository:

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Git LFS
git lfs install
```

### Download Models First
```bash
# Run the model setup script
python setup_models.py
```

### Push with Models
```bash
# 1. Initialize Git repository
git init

# 2. Add all files including models
git add .

# 3. Commit your changes
git commit -m "Round 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence System with offline models"

# 4. Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Without Models (Recommended)
- ✅ **Smaller repository size** (~10-50MB)
- ✅ **Faster Git operations**
- ✅ **No storage limits**
- ✅ **Models downloaded during Docker build**
- ❌ **Requires internet for first run**

### With Models
- ✅ **Fully offline capable**
- ✅ **No internet required**
- ❌ **Large repository size** (~500MB+)
- ❌ **Slower Git operations**
- ❌ **May hit GitHub storage limits**

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Use the first approach (without models)** because:

1. **Docker handles model downloads** during build
2. **Smaller repository** is better for sharing
3. **Faster cloning** for evaluators
4. **No storage issues** with GitHub

The models will be automatically downloaded when someone builds your Docker image.

# Approach Explanation

## Methodology Overview

Our solution implements a **persona-driven document intelligence system** that uses semantic analysis and content ranking to extract the most relevant sections from PDF documents. The approach consists of four core components working in harmony.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Document Structure Analysis
The system begins by extracting document outlines using PyMuPDF, identifying headings, sections, and content hierarchy. We employ advanced font size analysis, clustering algorithms (DBSCAN), and graph-based refinement to accurately detect document structure. This ensures robust handling of diverse document formats across different domains.

### 2. Persona and Task Understanding
Using spaCy's NLP capabilities, we extract domain-specific keywords from both the persona role and job-to-be-done description. The system identifies entities, noun chunks, and relevant terminology to create a semantic profile that guides content selection. This enables the system to understand context-specific requirements.

### 3. Semantic Content Ranking
We leverage the `intfloat/e5-small` sentence transformer model to compute semantic similarity between extracted keywords and document sections. The ranking algorithm considers both title and content relevance, with weighted scoring that prioritizes semantic alignment over simple keyword matching. This ensures the system captures nuanced relationships between user needs and document content.

### 4. Intelligent Content Extraction and Summarization
For each top-ranked section, the system extracts relevant subsections using bullet point detection and list analysis. We then apply keyword-based sentence ranking to create concise, contextually relevant summaries that maintain the original meaning while focusing on persona-specific information.

## Key Innovations

**Multi-level Analysis**: The system operates at document, section, and subsection levels, ensuring comprehensive coverage while maintaining relevance.

**Semantic Understanding**: Unlike traditional keyword matching, our approach uses embeddings to understand semantic relationships, enabling better generalization across diverse domains.

**Adaptive Processing**: The system automatically adjusts to different document structures and content types without requiring domain-specific configuration.

## Performance Optimization

The solution is optimized for CPU-only execution with a model size under 1GB. We use efficient preprocessing, parallel document processing, and optimized embedding computations to meet the 60-second processing constraint while maintaining accuracy.

## Generalization Capability

The approach is designed to generalize across diverse domains by focusing on universal document characteristics (structure, semantics, relevance) rather than domain-specific rules. This enables the system to handle academic papers, business reports, educational content, and other document types with consistent performance.
